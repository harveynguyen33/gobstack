# grep-ban.sh — a grep-backed ban probe with a fail-closed exit contract.
#
#   usage: grep-ban.sh -e <pattern> [-e <pattern> ...] <dir|file> ...
#
# Exit: 0 the tree is clean | 1 the ban is violated (offending lines on stdout)
#       2 the check could not run (no pattern, no path, or grep itself failed).
# It never exits 0 on a tool error - a ban that silently passes when its tool is missing
# is worse than advisory (PR-03 / D6).
#
# It reads TEXT, with no AST and no comments blanked: a `: any` inside a string or a
# comment is reported. That limit is stated, not hidden - the AST-grade form needs a
# parser the no-npm contract (docs/CONTRACTS.md) does not allow (docs/LIMITS.md #27).
#
# NARROW, EXPLICIT EXCEPTIONS (Dune rule 5). The engine exports two variables, and the hits are
# filtered BEFORE the exit code is chosen - a filter applied to stdout after the fact cannot
# change a verdict and is therefore decorative (W5-1: `bans_exempt:` produced a permanent RED):
#
#   GOBLIN_BANS_ID       the ban being probed (BN-01 ...)
#   GOBLIN_BANS_EXEMPT   newline-separated path prefixes this ban exempts
#
# A hit is dropped when its FILE is under an exempt prefix, or when the offending LINE carries
# the inline escape `// BAN-OK(<id>): <reason>`. Both are segment-aligned and both require the
# documented form: `src` exempts `src/a.ts` and `src/legacy/b.ts`, never `src2/c.ts`, and a
# `BAN-OK(<id>)` with no `: <reason>` after it is NOT an escape (it is a wish). When nothing is
# left the probe exits 0: there is no violation outside the declared exception.
