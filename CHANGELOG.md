One line per released version. `goblin-install --upgrade` prints the delta between the
version recorded in a target's `.goblin/installed.json` and the source `VERSION`.

## 0.1.0

- First version. Ships `bin/goblin-install`, `bin/goblin-verify`, `bin/goblin-model`,
  `bin/goblin-lib.sh`; `manifest/enforcement.tsv` (46 rules); 12 playbooks + `goblin-mode`
  + `practice` as Hermes project-local skills; 5 class presets; the templates; and
  `tests/run-tests.sh` with the negative control for every target-scope check class.
